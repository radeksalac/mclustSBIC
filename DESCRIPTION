Description: Extension of BIC for parameterized Gaussian mixture models fitted by EM algorithm initialized by model-based hierarchical clustering. This modifief BIC resolves the problematic of singular model selection problems, i.e. problems that involve models with Fisher information matrices that may fail to be invertable.
